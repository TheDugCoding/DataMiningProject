This repository contains our code for the assignments for the course INFOMDM Data Mining.

## Instructions
Due to parallelization, to call the functions the code must be structured in the following way:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #code
```

if the parallelization doesn't work, please change the value of MULTIPROCESSING to False
